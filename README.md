# RT-patient-appointment-scheduling

### Patient appointment scheduling is important for make sure cancer patients get their timely treatment to avoid prolonger wait time.

### 10 years of data was obtained and analyzed for the reasons behind prolonger wait time. 

### In order to optimized the appointment scheduling process, a two-stage hybrid flow shop scheduling model was developped to schedule both CT and radiation treatment (RT) appointments. Machine learning models are used to estimate the contouring and planning time based on patients' diagnosis information for the time frame between CT and RT.
